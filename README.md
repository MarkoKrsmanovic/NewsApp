Stuff not yet implemented: 

1. i18 localization
2. Usefull Unit Tests - due to time constraints mocking the redux store would take too long, and writing simple "isDefined" and "isCalled" tests didn't seem to make much sense
3. Search functionality - even though the logic behind it is very simple (array filter over an array of elements), I had no time to deal with the UI aspect of it.
